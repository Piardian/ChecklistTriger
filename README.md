# ChecklistTrigger

**Event-Driven Market Structure Analysis & Alerting Engine**

ChecklistTrigger is a TypeScript/Node.js market-analysis system that ingests multi-timeframe candle data, evaluates market-structure conditions, scores potential setups, and delivers candidate alerts through Telegram.

The project is structured as an event-driven data pipeline rather than a single indicator script.

## What it analyzes

The current analysis pipeline includes:

- Swing detection
- Break of Structure (BOS)
- Change of Character (CHoCH)
- Range detection
- Liquidity sweep detection
- Order Blocks
- Fair Value Gaps (FVG)
- Premium / Discount classification
- Displacement quality
- POI test tracking
- Model determination
- Grade calculation

The system is currently focused on EUR/USD and GBP/USD workflows.

## Runtime architecture

```text
server/
├── twelveDataClient.ts   Market-data client
├── poller.ts             Scheduled acquisition + orchestration
└── index.ts              Runtime startup + health endpoint

src/                       Analysis and domain logic
tests/                     Automated validation
```

The runtime uses different polling intervals for 15m, 1h, and 4h data and performs a controlled cold-start sequence to avoid unnecessary API pressure.

## Quick start

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

The service exposes a `GET /health` endpoint for runtime health checks.

## Engineering focus

The main engineering objective is to make market-data processing deterministic, modular, testable, and observable.

Instead of hiding all logic behind a single signal function, the pipeline separates:

1. Data acquisition
2. Candle persistence
3. Market-structure detection
4. POI/model evaluation
5. Candidate grading
6. Notification delivery

This separation makes individual stages easier to validate and evolve.

## Validation

The repository contains automated tests and a GitHub Actions quality workflow that runs the test and build pipeline on repository changes.

## Design considerations

The system is designed for continuously updated market data, so operational concerns matter alongside analysis logic. Polling cadence, cold-start behavior, API pressure, persistence, health checks, and notification delivery are treated as first-class runtime concerns.

## Limitations

- Market data depends on the upstream Twelve Data API
- Analysis outputs are experimental
- Setup grades are not guarantees of market outcomes
- The project is not a live execution or profitability system
- Results should not be interpreted as financial advice

## Roadmap

- Broader instrument and timeframe support
- More comprehensive historical validation
- Expanded event and candidate lifecycle tracking
- Improved observability and reporting
- Additional automated regression scenarios
